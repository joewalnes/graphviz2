\begin{abstract}
{\DOTTY} is a graph editor for the X Window System.  It may be run as a
standalone editor, or as a front end for applications that use graphs.  It can
control multiple windows viewing different graphs.

{\DOTTY} is written on top of {\DOT} and {\LEFTY}.  {\LEFTY} is a
general-purpose programmable editor for technical pictures.  It has an
interpretive programming language similar to AWK and C.  The user interface and
graph editing operations of {\DOTTY} are written as {\LEFTY} functions.
Programmer-defined graph operations may be loaded as well.  Graph layouts are
made by {\DOT}, which runs as a separate process that communicates with
{\LEFTY} through pipes.

The screen dump below shows a snapshot of a typical {\DOTTY} session.
