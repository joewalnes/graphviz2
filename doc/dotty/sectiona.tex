\chapter{Running {\DOTTY}}
\label{apprunning}
{\DOTTY} can be started by issuing the command:

\begin{verbatim}
dotty [-V] [-lm sync|async] [-el 0|1] [file1 file2 ...]
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
If flag {\tt -V} is specified, the program version is printed.  If the option
{\tt -lm sync} is specified, then graph layouts will be computed online
({\DOTTY} will block until a layout is finished).  The option {\tt -el 1}
enables the printing of warning messages.  If file names are specified on the
command line, the graphs contained in these files will be displayed each in its
own {\DOTTY} window.
