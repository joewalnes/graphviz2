0.3 - updated for tk8.3

0.2 - changed splinetest.tcl to allow postscript printing on Windows. 
      Patch from Michael Schwartz and Jan Nijtmans.  
      Reported to work with Michael's "Printer" extension:
          http://www.du.edu/~mschwart/tcl-tk.htm

    - in postscript output use old spline function if number 
      of points invalid.  Patch from Jan.Nijtmans@cmg.nl

    - extend splinetest.tcl to work without dash patch if necessary
      (e.g. if Tk_CreateSmoothMethod() gets into the core before
      the rest of the dash patches.)

    - support for TCL_STUBS ( tested with tk8.1.1+plus+dash )

0.1 - first release
