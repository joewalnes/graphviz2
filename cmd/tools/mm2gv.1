.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mm2gv
converts a sparse matrix of the Matrix Market format to a graph in the GV (formerly DOT) format. 
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-c
This flag causes \fBmm2gv\fP to assign colors to the edges. The matrix element is scaled to the
range [0,1] depending on where it lies between the minimum and maximum set matrix values. This
scaled value is used as the \fI"wt"\fP attribute of the corresponding edge. 
In addition, this scalar value is mapped to an RGB value, which is stored as the edge \fI"color"\fP.
.TP
.B \-l
If set, \fBmm2gv\fP attaches a label to the graph indicating the base name of the input file,
and the number of nodes and edges.
.TP
.B \-u
If specified, the graph is assumed to be undirected. By default, the graph generated is directed. 
.TP
.B \-v
This flag causes \fBmm2gv\fP to store the matrix values as the \fI"len"\fP attribute of the
corresponding edge.
.TP
.BI \-o "outfile"
Prints output to the file \fIoutfile\fP. If not given, \fBmm2gv\fP
uses stdout.
.TP
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I file
Name of the file in MatrixMarket format.
If no
.I file
operand is specified,
the standard input will be used.
.SH RETURN CODES
Return \fB0\fP
if there were no problems during conversion;
and non-zero if any error occurred.
